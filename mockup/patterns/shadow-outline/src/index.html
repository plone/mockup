    <br>Users only have to give alignment parameter by 'align:*%' in order to align the elements text.<br><br>
Then the pattern will automatically generate a box shadow of the element on which its applied.<br><br>
Only thing to be kept in mind is that the box shadow will be of specified length as described in the code.
<br><br>
Althougth it is able to adjust its height itself according to length of element!<br>
