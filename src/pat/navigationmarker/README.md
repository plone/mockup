# Navigation marker pattern.

Add classes to the main navigation.

This pattern adds `inPath` and `current` classes to the navigation to allow a different style on selected navigation items or navigation items which are in the current path.
This is done in JavaScript, so that the navigation pattern can be cached for the whole site.
