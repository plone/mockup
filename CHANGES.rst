Changelog
=========

2.5 (Unreleased)
----------------

Breaking changes:

- *add item here*

New features:

- For ``pat-modal``, let the ajax modal variant acquire it's ajax url when the modal is shown instead when the pattern is initialized.
  This makes the modal respect a dynamically changed href attribute on a anchor tag, after it was initialized.
  [thet]

- New pattern ``mockup-patterns-structureupdater`` to update title and description depending on the current context on Plone's folder contents page.
  [thet]

- Add default plone color less variables for a more consistent design.
  They will be overwritten by values set by Plone or integration projects.
  [thet]

- Structure widget:
  - Show ineffective label in folder contents for not yet effective and published content, likewise it's done with expires.
    Show effective and ineffective label styled as bootstrap badges.
  - Show "Description" below title, if it's set in ``availableColumns`` and ``activeColumns`` to save some screen space.
  - Do not break whitespace within actionmenu links and don't underline them when hovering.
  - Trigger ``context-info-loaded`` on body to be able to listen to the event outside the pattern.
  [thet]

- Related Items widget:
    - Add new mode "auto", which automatically sets ``search`` mode when a searchterm is present, otherwise ``browse`` mode.
    - Use searchterm as substring, which matches also within words by wrapping searchterm with the "*" wildcard.
    - Show a "One level up" button in the result set in browse mode.
    - Show folder icons in in the result set front of items instead a arrow behind the items.
    - Filter out non-selectable and non-folderish items in the result set when in browse mode.
    - Add option to scan the selected list of items for other patterns.
    - Add option for contextPath - objects with this path will not be selectable. This prevents the object where the relation is set on to from being selected and self-referenced.
  [thet]

- Bring in TinyMCE 4.6.1
  [frapell]

Bug fixes:

- Fixed path to tooltip less files.
  This gave an ugly site in develoment mode when editing the loggedin bundle css.
  Fixes `issue 1843 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/1843>`_.
  [maurits]

  [thet]

- fix datepicker markup, see plone/Products.CMFPlone#1953 - removes also ugly separator and uses CSS to add space.
  [jensens]

- fix pat-moment: localization of default date display.
  This was american english only, now it uses the configured locale format LLL (see momentjs docs) which is almost the same,
  but works in any language.
  [jensens]

- fix structure pattern: do not use a relative date in structure pattern, editors are complaining and it indeed is bad UX.
  format with date and time in localized format 'L LT'
  [jensens]

  [jensens]

2.4.0 (2017-02-20)
------------------

Incompatibilities:

- The related items and structure patterns have changed quite a lot.
  Customizations might break due to these changes.
  See below.


New:

- PickADate pattern: Add a button to set the date or time to now and another to clear all inputs.
  Remove the clear buttons from the date and time picker itself, as they allowed incomplete input submission (e.g. date only when date and time were required).
  Also remove the now obsolete footer buttons as a whole from the date picker.
  Add options ``today`` and  ``clear`` to hide those buttons when set to ``false``.
  Use ``display: inline-block`` instead of problematic ``float:left``.
  Refs: PR #740, Fixes #732.
  [thet]

- PickADate pattern: Add option to automatically set the time when changing the date.
  It defaults to set the time to the current time.
  [thet]

- Change default sort option in livesearch pattern.
  [rodfersou]

- Show expired label in folder contents for expired attributes
  [vangheem]

- Related Items refactorings:

    - Make "search" and "browse" mode user-selectable via buttons.

    - Remove obsolete tree widget, use "browse" mode instead.

    - Let "search" mode search recursively.

    - Let "browse" mode start from current path.

    - Immediately open select2 results when clicking on "Browse" or "Search" or browsing somewhere.

    - Show only selectable items in "search" mode, if defined.

    - Show only selectable and folderish items in "browse" mode, if selctable items are defined.

    - Exclude already selected items in result list.

    - Default closeOnSelect to true.

    - Show "Open folder" arrow only when in "browse" mode.

    - Seperate templates from JavaScript into xml files.

    - Allow optional image and file upload (especially useful for image and file reference widgets).

    - Allow configuration of "favorites" to quickly switch the current path via a dropdown menu.

    - Adapt TinyMCE pattern to related item changes and remove now obsolete selection and result templates.

    - Calculate all paths relative to the ``rootPath``, so that breadcrumbs navigation and favorites do not show paths outside the rootPath.

    - For results and selected items with images, add a line break after the image.
  [thet]


- More Related items pattern:

    - Result button style allow for more room for scrollbar, and have subltle color change on hover to deliniate user-expected behavior of browsing vs. selecting item.

    - Related Items pattern: content icon cross-compatibility with Plone 5.x and 4.x (via plone.app.widgets 1.x); in Plone 5 getIcon returned from brain is a boolean, in Plone 4, it is a string -- use this to show content icons in Plone 5 as previous, but also show image scale in Plone 4, but only for images.  This is the most reasonable solution to avoid requesting many broken image scales (404) in Plone 4.

  [seanupton]


- Structure pattern refactorings:

    - Prevent popovers to be closed when clicking on non-visible elements which still use screen space (those with visibility: hidden or opacity: 0). That in addition to elements, which are not visible at all and do not use screen space (display: none). Prevents upload form in structure pattern to be closed when opening the file selection tool.

    - Use thumb scale for image preview in rename dialog and optimize the rename dialog layout.

    - Remove ``pat-relateditems`` path selection widget but make sure, the path can still be set via navigation within the structure pattern.

    - Add ``css`` action menu item option and always do a pattern scan on action menu items. This allows to set patterns on them, e.g. to open a modal or use tooltips.

    - Sort Available Columns dialog entries.

  [thet]


- Contentloader pattern: Remotely loaded HTML content is wrapped in a ``div`` element, to allow jQuery to find also the first element.
  jQuery starts to search at it's first child element.
  [thet]

- TinyMCE: Simplify definition of custom imageScales by passing a JSON string.
  [thet]

- Upload pattern: Add option ``allowPathSelection`` to disable the related items path selection.
  [thet]

  [ebrehault]

- Add select2 result class based on value of option so it can be styled
  [vangheem]

  of plain string to make importcss-plugin more configurable through pattern
  [datakurre]

- Add ``defaultSortOn`` option in ``livesearch`` pattern.
  [Gagaro]

  [thet]

------------------

Incompatibilities:

- Remove support for node version < ``0.11`` and update travis dependencies.
  [thet]

- Needs RequireJS configuration for ``mockup-patterns-relateditems-url``.
  [thet]


New:

- Related items pattern: Result button style allow for more room for scrollbar, and have subltle color change on hover to deliniate user-expected behavior of browsing vs. selecting item.
  [seanupton]

 - Related items pattern: Related Items pattern: content icon cross-compatibility with Plone 5.x and 4.x (via plone.app.widgets 1.x); in Plone 5 getIcon returned from brain is a boolean, in Plone 4, it is a string -- use this to show content icons in Plone 5 as previous, but also show image scale in Plone 4, but only for images.  This is the most reasonable solution to avoid requesting many broken image scales (404) in Plone 4.
  [seanupton]

- Structure pattern refactorings:

    - Allow definition of action menu items not only as dropdowns but also as buttons.

    - Add ``openItem`` and ``editItem`` actions as buttons and remove the open icon from the title column.

    - Open ``openItem`` links according to ``typeToViewAction`` instead of default with the ``/view`` postfix.

    - Open ``editItem`` under ``/@@edit`` instead ``/edit``.

    - Remove JS event handlers for externally opening simple URLs and use the href attribute instead.

    - Add ``iconCSS`` option for action menus items to add icons.

    - Add ``modal`` option for action menus items to allow links open in a modal.

    - Add ``iconSize`` option to set the icon size if a item has an image.

    - Use icons for all actionmenu entries.

    - Use the tooltip pattern for all actionmenu buttons.

    - Use pat-moment also for ``start``, ``end`` and ``last_comment_date`` columns.

    - For columns with date fields, show an empty column if the date value is 'None'.

    - Remove the checkbox and the actionmenu from the breadcrumbs bar for the current active folder to simplify the structure pattern.
      The actionmenu contained redundant actions (cut, copy, paste) and selecting the current folder is possible one level up.

    - Don't show empty alerts with ``alert-warning`` CSS class.
      Show them transparent but in the same height as if they were not empty.
      Align HTML structue with bootstrap ones and use ``<strong>`` for alert labels.

    - Fix rearrange button

  for interaction with the server side API for item generation.

  Where applicable, the default implementation are now named requirejs

  Incidentally, this also required a major cleanup/refactoring of how
  the ResultCollection class interacts with the pattern and its support
  classes.
  [metatoaster]

- TinyMCE and upload pattern: Re-add triggering of the ``uploadAllCompleted``
  event and pass the server's response and path uid to it. TinyMCE's link
  plugin is listening to it and uses the information to create a URL out of the
  uploaded files. Fixes #471.
  [thet]

- Update Dropzone.js to it's latest 4.0.1 version.
  [thet]

- hide some fields from plone-legacy bundle interface since that bundle
  is a special case

  original scale as often
  [vangheem]

- TinyMCE: bugfix, where a link had to be guessed because of missing data-
  attributes, use set instead of setRaw. Add tests.
  [frapell]

- Add recurrence pattern styles to widget bundle.
  [thet]

- lazy load translations so we can potential hold off detecting language until
  the DOM is loaded
  [vangheem]

- Change all index references from ``Type`` to ``portal_type``. E.g. the
  TinyMCE configuration option ``containsobjects`` expects portal_type values,
  not Type.

2.0.2 (2015-04-01)
------------------

- Upgrade patternslib and mockup-core to fix install issues
  [vangheem]

- Use i18n.currentLanguage to initialise TinyMCE lang option. Fallback to
  closest lang if the required one is missing in TinyMCE (for instance, if
  fr_be.js is missing, we try fr.js and if fr.js is missing, we try fr_Fr.js).
  [ebrehault, davisp1]

------------------

- make sure mockup can be installable with bower again
  [vangheem]

- Bring back TinyMCE ``sed`` and ``copy`` from ``mockup`` into ``mockup-core``.
  If we create bundles from an external package based on patterns from mockup,
  we don't want to care about the sed and copy tasks too. Instead, those should
  be defined on the patterns itself, but thats for a future release.
  [thet]

- Add ``id`` and ``Title`` to the default available columns of the structure
  pattern.

  Patternslib outside of Plone. For changes required to patterns, see:
  mockup/GETTING_STARTED.md . Refs: #460.

  setting / getting the state of ``multiple``, ``selected``, ``checked`` and
  ``disabled`` states.
  [thet]

  [thet]

  ``tinymce-builded``, since the ``tinymce`` dependency already points to the

  include the language files, which are needed.

  [ebrehault]

- Fix broken HTML tag on structure pattern's ``actionmenu.xml``.
  [datakurre]

  ``@{bowerPath}`` less variable where possible.
  [thet]
