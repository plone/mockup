      <h2>Quick-start </h2>
<pre>
Install Git
Install Node/NPM
$ git clone git://github.com/plone/mockup.git
$ cd mockup
$ make bootstrap</pre>
      <p>
        And your environment is ready to start working on testable, modular, JavaScript!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in developing in mockup, then seeing its use
        directly in Plone, check out the <a href='https://github.com/plone/buildout.deco'>buildout.deco</a>
        project on GitHub.
      </p>

      <h2>Slower-start</h2>
      <h3>Step 1: Get the tools</h3>
      <p>
        Download and install the latest versions of <a href='http://git-scm.org' title='git'>git</a> and
        <a href='http://www.nodejs.org/' title='node and npm'>Node/<abbr title="Node Package Manager">NPM</abbr></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also make certain your system supports the <code>make</code> command.
        Right now development of this project is being done primarily on Linux
        and OS X, so setting up the tooling on MS Windows might be an
        adventure for you to explore -- though, all of the tools used have equivalent
        versions for that platform, so with a little effort, it should work!
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Checkout the Mockup project from GitHub</h3>
      <p>
        This will give you a starting point, and a lot of example code. It's used
        to build <em>bundles</em> which are then added to various Plone products.
        You do not need to develop code for the existing Plone products when you
        use the Mockup project.
      </p>
  <pre>
  git clone git://github.com/plone/mockup.git</pre>

      <h3>Step 3: Bootstrap the environment</h3>
      <p>
        Run the following commands:
      </p>
  <pre>
  cd mockup
  make bootstrap</pre>
      <p>
        This will use Node/NPM to download and install all the requirements for
        building and bundling, as well as all the external libraries needed to
        build the patterns developed within the framework of the mockup project.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Get hacking!</h3>
      <h4>Mockup Project Structure</h4>
      <p class='alert alert-info'>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: The project is under heavy development, so expect
        things to move around a bit.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>build/</strong> All combined, optimized, and minimized JavaScript code, as well as compiled less and media are copied and placed here</li>
        <li><strong>js/</strong> This directory contains all of the modularized JavaScript code</li>
        <li><strong>js/config.js</strong> This file contains the RequireJS configuration</li>
        <li><strong>js/fakeserver.js</strong> This file is useful for development -- it contains the code for setting up fake responses to XHR</li>
        <li><strong>js/bundles</strong> This is where a bundle is defined -- it is a set of requirements and code that provide the features being packaged into a Plone product</li>
        <li><strong>js/patterns</strong> This is a directory that contains all individual, encapsulated patterns (i.e. widgets/JavaScript)</li>
        <li><strong>less/</strong> This directory contains all the <a href='http://lesscss.org/'>less</a> code for all the patterns and bundles</li>
        <li><strong>lib/</strong> This directory contains external libraries not necessarily found in the bower repositories</li>
        <li><strong>tests/</strong> This directory contains all tests for patterns and bundles, including gernal setup and configuration code</li>
        <li><strong>Gruntfile.js</strong> This file contains the directives for compiling less, and combining/optimizing/minimizing JavaScript for the defined bundles</li>
        <li><strong>index.html</strong> This is the main source of documentation for the mockup project.</li>
        <li><strong>Makefile</strong> This is the Makefile used to define what tasks should run when you want to build a bundle, or bootstrap the environment</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What's a Pattern? What Are Bundles? How do they relate?</h4>
      <p>
        <em>Patterns</em> are units of JavaScript, defined by a RequireJS/AMD style module.
        Patterns may require other patterns to operate, and may require third
        party libraries. Think of patterns as a module -- encapsulated and
        separate, and providing a widget or tool to use by other patterns or
        in html.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Bundles</em> are defined similar to <em>Patterns</em> -- they are
        encapsulated bits of JavaScript that define requirements for a bundle,
        and have some extra code in them that's useful for integrating the
        required patterns into Plone products.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the end result is that a front-end developer might spend their time
        creating patterns, while a Plone developer might create a bundle and
        integrate it into a Plone product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>plone.app.widgets</em> is a good example of a bundle. The
        <strong>js/bundles/widgets.js</strong> file contains a RequireJS module
        that defines all the requirements for plone.app.widgets, and
        adds some specific code to make the requirements work nicely in the
        <em>plone.app.widgets</em> Plone module.
      </p>
      <h4>What's up with this documentation?</h4>
      <p>
        Most of the documentation found outside of code comments is found in this
        single HTML file. Take a look at it, and if you want to contribute, hack
        away!
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is it done this way? It's convenient for the time being.
      </p>
      <h4>How are patterns created that DON'T belong to plone.app.*?</h4>
      <p>
        Check out some of the other patterns in <strong>js/patterns/</strong>,
        then check out the bundle code in <strong>js/bundles</strong>. Once
        you have a bundle, and maybe some patterns created for your own product,
        you'll want to add some configuration directives to the <strong>Gruntfile.js</strong>
        file. Then, you can run <code>$ make</code> to build your bundle into
        the <strong>build/</strong> directory, and from there, copy over the
        releasable code into your Plone product.
      </p>
      <h4>Tutorials?</h4>
      <p>
        Currently there are no tutorials for using this project, but they will
        be forth coming -- <em>Especially</em> if you decide to contribute to the
        project!
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, the best way to learn is to dig into the patterns, bundles,
        and less code, then join the <code>#plone</code> IRC channel on
        freenode, and start asking questions!
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5: Bundling</h3>
      <p>To build bundles:</p>
      <pre>make</pre>

      <h3>Step 6: Testing</h3>
      <h4>Running tests</h4>
      <p>And you can run tests with:</p>
      <pre>make test</pre>
      <p>
        Right now tests are
        <img src="https://api.travis-ci.org/plone/mockup.png?branch=master"
             alt="Build Status" />.
      </p>
      <h4>Adding new tests</h4>
      <p>To add new tests, you can add them into the <tt>tests</tt> directory.
      They will automatically be picked up by the test runner if they are named
      with a suffix of:</p>
      <pre>-test.js</pre>
      <p>For example, to add a new test for the <tt>foobar</tt> pattern, 
      you should name your test file like so:</p>
      <pre>pattern-foobar-test.js</pre>
      </p>

      <h3>Step 7: Releasing/Passing bundles on to Plone developers</h3>
      <p>
        This is the part that developers in the Plone community are currently
        familiar with, and the step that purely front-end developers will have to
        pass off their products. This step is all about taking the bundled
        JavaScript and adding it to Plone products in the ways JavaScript has
        always been added.

        <h2>What's the purpose of this project?</h2>
        <p>
          The <em>mockup</em> project intends to improve the testing and modularization
          story of the JavaScript used inside Plone. Further, it aims to make developing
          client-side widgets and tools more approachable for developers who are
          familiar with JavaScript and related tooling.
        </p>

        <h2>How does this project achieve better modularization of JavaScript, and what kind of benefits come from it?</h2>
        <p>
          Specifically, this project uses
          <a href='http://requirejs.org/' target='_blank'>RequireJS</a>, a library
          that adheres to the
          <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition' target='_blank'>AMD</a>
          concept of JavaScript modularization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a great page outlining the motivations for AMD:
          <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html" target="_blank">Why AMD?</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, it gives us a standard way to encapsulate JavaScript, and a
          mechanism for combining, optimizing, and minimizing code when it's bundled.
          On top of that, the overall process involved is known to developers outside
          the plone community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, however, <em>RequireJS</em> itself is really only used during
          the development of this project. When the code here is packaged and released,
          it's combined into bundles of code, and a library called
          <a href='https://github.com/jrburke/almond' target='_blank'>Almond</a> is
          used in place of <em>RequireJS</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Almond</em> is a small shim loader for the <em>AMD</em> specification.
          It completely replaces <em>RequireJS</em> for production use, providing
          the interface, but not all the dynamic loading capabilities -- which
          aren't needed since all the JavaScript is bundled up into single files.
          <em>Almond</em> comes in at right around <strong>1kb</strong>
          when all is said and done, which makes for very light overhead.
        </p>

        <h2>How does this project achieve better testing of JavaScript, and why should anyone care?</h2>
        <p>
          Currently JavaScript in Plone is <em>not tested at all</em>. So, to begin,
          *any* testing is an improvement. Beyond that, it's a nightmare to upgrade
          a JavaScript library -- there is no way of understanding all the
          ramifications of such a change. With tests, you can know immediately
          what parts of your code fail, and what parts you need to update.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complex JavaScript becomes more reliable!
        </p>

        <h2>How does this project make developing widgets and front-end tooling more approachable?</h2>
        <p>
          There are two big things that make this project really approachable
          for front-end developers: using tools commonly used for JavaScript
          development, and no need to install and understand Plone.
        </p>
        <p>
          If front-end developers already have a suite of awesome tools to use,
          why bother creating custom ones that are only used in the Plone
          community? Certainly there is a time and place for specialized tools,
          but people who specialize in JavaScript and front-end development
          can be more effective with tools they're familiar with if they don't
          have to mix Plone into their process.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also allows contribution back to the JavaScript community -- if
          Plone takes advantage of the products that come out of the JavaScript
          community, we can contribute back, and maybe even garner interest
          in members of the JavaScript community contributing to Plone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, this project only needs <em>git</em> and <em>npm/node</em>.
          There is no reason to download and install Plone to start developing
          widgets and front-end tooling. This make starting development on
          the front-end really fast!
        </p>
        <p>
          The point at which Plone needs to be installed is when a bundle needs
          to be integrated into a Plone product. And then, a front-end developer
          might be able to just pass along their code to someone with more
          Plone knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is this better than the status quo?</h2>
        <p>
          Plone has zero tests for JavaScript, people are scared to poke it, and
          knowledge of Plone development is required. This means that only people
          who are both knowledgable with Plone and JavaScript add to Plone's
          JavaScript story, and even then tend to tread lightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project aims to make developers be capable of being bold and
          innovative when it comes to JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h2>Isn't this a lot of work and code just to hack some JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, this process does break things up a bit -- but think of the
          advantages. Testable code, more potential developers, and a better
          front-end workflow.
        </p>

        <h2>What's this projects relation to the Patternslib project?</h2>
        <p>
          This project draws heavy inspiration from
          <a href='http://patternslib.com/' target='_blank'>PatternsLib</a>,
          but does not share any code.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I use this in Plone right now?</h2>
        <p>
          Sort of. It's in heavy development, so installing the related Plone
          packages are on the edge of what this project aims to become.
        </p>

        <h2>What's the relation to plone.app.toolbar? plone.app.widgets?</h2>
        <p>
          They provide Plone integration with the JavaScript developed
          and tested in the <em>mockup</em> project. JavaScript is bundled,
          optimized, compressed, then packaged within the products. In the package
          itself, views and other integrations are made to override existing
          aspects with their newer equivalents.
        </p>

        <h2>What about plone.app.tiles, plone.app.deco, etc?</h2>
        <p>
          These are a much larger topic, and need a lot of work. The core of
          this initiative is found within <em>plone.app.widgets</em> and
          <em>plone.app.toolbar</em>. Once these are done, tiles, deco, and more
          won't be far behind.
        </p>

        <h2>I just want add a custom widget, but I don't want to contribute it to this project, what do I do?</h2>
        <p>
          Check out the <a href='#getting-started'>getting started</a> page to
          learn how to get started with developing your own custom patterns!
        </p>

        <h2>What is a bundle?</h2>
        <p>
          A bundle is a combination of JavaScript, CSS, and other media that
          are meant to be delivered into a specific Plone product.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance,
          the <em>plone.app.widgets</em> product is a bundle consisting of the
          combined, optimized, and minimized JavaScript, the compiled CSS (from
          less), and other resourcese (such as images).
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, developers will only add to the widgets and toolbar
          bundles if they are contributing to the <em>plone.app.widgets</em>
          or <em>plone.app.toolbar</em> projects. Normally developers creating
          code for new products will create new bundles for their specific
          product.

      <p>Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said
        spanking. It walked on my pillow! How about a turtle? I've always
        loved those leathery little snappy faces.</p>

      <p>Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. Butterscotch!</p>

      <p>Want a lick? Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was
        a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist.</p>
      <h4>Title 2</h4>
      <p>You boys know how to shovel coal? Don't worry, these young

        us could talk man-on-man.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    You can use this inside Plone or on any static page. Please check below for additional directions for non-Plone sites as there are some lines of code you need to add to the header of your webpage.
    <h3>Adding tooltip using Plone</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Make sure your viewing the page you want to add the tool tip too.</li>
      <li> Log in </li>
      <li> Create some text that you want to be the link that will reveal the tooltip. </li>
      <li> Select the view html button</li>
      <li>Find your text. and wrap that text with an href tag, and add a class and the href tag. <br>
      It should look like &lt; a class=&quot;pat-tooltip&quot; href=&quot;#my-demo-tip&quot;&gt; My link text &lt;/a&gt;</li>
      <li>Choose Save</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Now that we have added our link we now need to add our tooltip. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose &quot;edit&quot;</li>
      <li>Immediently following the link click to add some text and hit your &quot;return&quot; key</li>
      <li>Add the text that you want to be the tip.</li>
      <li>Choose the &quot;edit html&quot; button</li>
      <li>Find the tip text and wrap that text with a div tag, an ID tag and a class.<br>
      It should look like &lt;div id=&quot;my-demo-tip&quot; class=&quot;tooltips&quot;&gt; My Tip Text here &lt;/div&gt;</li>
      <li>Choose Save and test your tooltip.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Note: it's important that the href AND the ID be named exactly the same thing. This is what links them together.</p>
    <h3>Adding tooltip not using Plone</h3>
    <p>TODO</p>
  </script>
  <script type="text/example" class="example-tooltip">
    <p href=".example-class" class="pat-tooltip">
     Hover over this line to see a tooltip
    </p>

    <p class="tooltips example-class">
      Setting the .example-class in the href makes this show up
