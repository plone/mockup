            <p>Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said
              spanking. It walked on my pillow! How about a turtle? I've always
              loved those leathery little snappy faces.</p>

            <p>Want a lick? Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was
              a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist.</p>
            <h3>Title 2</h3>
            <p>You boys know how to shovel coal? Don't worry, these young
              beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. I thought the two of

                <p>I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it?
                  Everybody dance… NOW. Actually, that was a box of Oscar's
                  legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky
                  weed. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? We
                  need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. O-kay, who'd like

                  you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the
                  Jacuzzi. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the
                  future. I've been in the film business for a while but I just
                  can't seem to get one in the can. Oh, I don't have any drugs
                  for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car?

                <p>No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Michael
                  was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called
                  Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant
                  was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's
                  Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu.
                  Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Look, you are playing
                  adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing
                  grab-ass in the shower. I just don't want him to point out my
                  cracker ass in front of Ann. How about a turtle? I've always
                  loved those leathery little snappy faces. I believe you will
                  find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So
                  we don't get dessert?</p>


                <p>I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue

                  English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. We need
                  a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top
                  that. (They never did.) Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year
                  older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess
                  that's kind of funny. I am going to my spin class. I thought
                  you had vertigo. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly

                  Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd
                  gone in head first, like Pete Rose. I know she's a brownish

                <p>Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. So, what do you

                <p>So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing
                  me! Don't call my escorts whores.</p>


                <p>Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual

                  coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. One for the ladies.
                  Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! Fried cheese… with club

                  Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. Say goodbye to THESE!</p>


                <p>So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing
                  me! Don't call my escorts whores.</p>


                <p>Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual
                  intercourse. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed
                  libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Ah
                  coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. One for the ladies.
                  Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! Fried cheese… with club
                  sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with
                  spicy club sauce. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn
                  shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club
                  sauce. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl
                  this town has ever seen.</p>


                <p>I don't care if it takes from now till the end of
                  Shrimpfest. You might wanna lean away from that fire since
                  you're soaked in alcohol.</p>
