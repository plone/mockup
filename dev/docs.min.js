Right now\ndevelopment of this project is being done primarily on Linux and OS X, so\nsetting up the tooling on MS Windows might be an adventure for you to\nexplore -- though, all of the tools used have equivalent versions for that\nplatform, so with a little effort, it should work!\n\n\n## Step 2: Checkout the Mockup project from GitHub\n\nThis will give you a starting point, and a lot of example code. It\'s used to\nbuild *bundles* which are then added to various Plone products.  You do\nnot need to develop code for the existing Plone products when you use the\nMockup project.:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/plone/mockup.git\n\n## Step 3: Bootstrap the environment\n\nRun the following commands::\n\n    cd mockup\n    make bootstrap\n\nThis will use Node/NPM to download and install all the requirements for\nbuilding and bundling, as well as all the external libraries needed to build\nthe patterns developed within the framework of the mockup project.\n\n## Step 4: Get hacking!\n\n### Mockup Project Structure\n\n * `build/` : All combined, optimized, and minimized JavaScript code, as well\n   as compiled less and media are copied and placed here\n\n * `docs/` : Documentation files built with `make docs`\n\n * `js/` : This directory contains all of the modularized JavaScript code\n\n    * `js/config.js` : This file contains the RequireJS configuration\n\n    * `js/bundles` : This is where a bundle is defined -- it is a set of\n      requirements and code that provide the features being packaged into\n      a Plone product\n\n    * `js/patterns` : This is a directory that contains all individual,\n      encapsulated patterns (i.e. widgets/JavaScript)\n\n * `less/` : This directory contains all the [less](http://lesscss.org/) code\n   for all the patterns and bundles\n\n * `lib/` : This directory contains external libraries not necessarily found in\n   the bower repositories\n\n * `tests/` : This directory contains all tests for patterns and bundles,\n   including general setup and configuration code\n\n * `Gruntfile.js` : This file contains the directives for compiling less, and\n   combining/optimizing/minimizing JavaScript for the defined bundles\n\n * `index.html` : This is the main source of documentation for the mockup\n   project.\n\n * `Makefile` :  This is the Makefile used to define what tasks should run when\n   you want to build a bundle, or bootstrap the environment\n\n### What\'s a Pattern? What Are Bundles? How do they relate?\n\n`Patterns` are units of JavaScript, defined by a RequireJS/AMD style module.\nPatterns may require other patterns to operate, and may require third party\nlibraries. Think of patterns as a module -- encapsulated and separate, and\nproviding a widget or tool to use by other patterns or in html.\n\n`Bundles` are defined similar to <em>Patterns</em> -- they are encapsulated\nbits of JavaScript that define requirements for a bundle, and have some extra\ncode in them that\'s useful for integrating the required patterns into Plone\nproducts.\n\nSo, the end result is that a front-end developer might spend their time\ncreating patterns, while a Plone developer might create a bundle and integrate\nit into a Plone product.\n\nFor more information how to create patterns please read [Hello\nworld](#hello-world) example.\n\n## Step 5: Bundling\n\nTo build bundles::\n\n    make bundle\n\n## Step 6: Testing\n\nYou can run tests with::\n\n    make test\n\nThis will start a continuous process that will rerun the tests when you change\nany of the js files.\n\nIf you want to run tests on once and then quick::\n\n    make test-once\n\nIf you have Chrome installed you can alternatively run your tests with::\n\n    make test-dev\n\nRunning tests in Chrome is useful when you want to debug them.\n\nIf you want to just run the tests for the pattern you are working on you can\nrun tests with::\n\n    make test pattern=foobar\n\nor:\n\n    make test-once pattern=foobar\n\nor:\n\n    make test-dev pattern=foobar\n\nThese will run only the tests that end with foobar-test.js\n'}),define("text!docs-tutorial",[],function(){return'# Introduction\n\nCAUTION: this is a work in progress. Things might change without advance notice\nand errors in the docs are possible. You have been warned. ;-)\n\nAssuming you successfully set up your development environment as described\nunder the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section, you are now ready to\nwrite your first pattern!\n\nUnless stated otherwise the <em>mockup</em> directory (the one that you\ncloned the repository into) will be our root working directory throughout this\ntutorial and all the paths and filenames are specified **relative** to it.\n\nThe mockup directory on your filesystem filesystem should look like the\nfollowing (NOTE: most of the files and folders have been omitted for brevity):\n\n<pre>\nmockup/\n  js/\n    bundles/\n      widgets.js\n    patterns/\n    ui/\n    config.js\n  less/\n  lib/\n  plone/\n    mockup/\n  tests/\n  bower.json\n  Gruntfile.js\n  package.json\n  &hellip;\n</pre>\n<strong>(XXX: test on a fresh instance if correct!)<br>\nXXX: needed at all? it just occupies a lot of space ...</strong>\n\n\n<h2>Creating a New Pattern</h2>\n<p>Our Hello World pattern will be very simple - all it will do is change the text\nof some HTML label to "Hello, World!". So let\'s get started!</p>\n\n<h3>Defining the Pattern</h3>\n\n<p> The first step is to go to the <em>js/patterns</em> subdirectory and create\na file called <em>hello.js</em> in it with the following contents:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>define</strong>([\n    \'jquery\',\n    <strong>\'mockup-patterns-base\'</strong>\n], function ($, Base) {\n    \n\n    var HelloWorld = <strong>Base.extend</strong>({\n        name: \'helloworld\',\n        <strong>init</strong>: function () {\n            var $label = <strong>this.$el</strong>;\n            $label.text("Hello, world!");\n        }\n    });\n\n    <strong>return HelloWorld;</strong>\n});\n</pre>\n<strong>XXX: syntax highlighting?</strong>\n\n<p>\nThe file contains a call to the RequireJS\'s\n<a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#define">define()</a> function, which\n(unsurprisingly) defines a new JavaScript code module. We pass two parameters\nto it:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>An array containing the names of module\'s dependencies. We state that we\n  depend on jQuery and the base Mockup pattern module.</li>\n  <li>A function which returns an object that defines our <em>Hello World</em>\n  module.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When called this function is passed all the objects representing the module\'s\ndependencies (in the same order as defined in the dependency list). This allows us\nto use these dependencies in our module\'s code.</p>\n\n<p>The way to actually create a new module is to call the <strong>Base.extend()</strong>\nmethod and pass the module definition to it. The latter is just an object with\nsome properties, and as you can see the object describing our Hello World pattern is\nin fact very simple. It only contains a <var>name</var> property definining its name\nand an <strong>init()</strong> method. The latter does the actual work of changing\nthe label\'s text to <em>"Hello, world!"</em>.</p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering what the <code>this.$el</code> construct stands for. It is\njust a reference to the DOM element on which the pattern has been invoked. In this\ncontext <code>this</code> points to the pattern object itself, while its attribute\n<code>$el</code> is a jQuery object wrapping that DOM element (or sometimes a subtree\nof DOM elements).</p>\n\n\n<h3>Pattern Registration</h3>\n\n<p>In order to use the pattern we need to tell the bundling machinery where to find\nit and to start including it in the JavaScript bundles we create. So first open the\nfile <em>js/config.js</em> and add the following line under <em>paths</em>\ndefinitions (omit the trailing comma if adding to the end of the paths list):</p>\n<pre>\n\'mockup-patterns-helloworld\': \'js/patterns/hello\',\n</pre>\n\n<p>This tells the bundling/packaging machinery that a module called\n<em>mockup-patterns-helloworld</em> is defined in the file <em>hello.js</em> under the\n<em>js/patterns</em> subdirectory (relative to where config.js is located). Note that\nwe omit the file\'s .js suffix in the path definition.</p>\n\n<p>To tell the machinery to include our pattern in the bundles, open the\n<em>js/bundles/widgets.js</em> file and add the <em>mockup-patterns-helloworld</em>\nto the list of dependencies passed to the <em>define()</em> function.\n<br>\n<strong>XXX: this is probably widgets-specific and will change after refactoring.\nUpdate this section at that point.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<pre>\ndefine([\n  \'jquery\',\n  &hellip;\n  <strong>\'mockup-patterns-helloworld\',</strong>\n  &hellip;\n], &hellip;)\n</pre>\n\n<p>For the dependency we use the same name as already used in the pattern path\ndefinition.<br>\nAs we learned in the Defining a Pattern section above, we also have to add a\ncorresponding HelloWorld parameter to the function passed to the <em>define()</em>\nas the second argument. Make sure that parameter\'s relative position matches the\nrelative position of the <em>mockup-patterns-helloworld</em> in the dependency list.\n</p>\n\n<pre>\nfunction($, Registry, &hellip;, <strong>HelloWorld</strong>, &hellip;) {\n    &hellip;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>We now have everything ready to create a JavaScript bundle containing our\nHello World pattern. From the &lt;mockup&gt; directory run the following console\ncommand:</p>\n\n<pre>\n$ make bundle-widgets\n</pre>\n\n<p>This determines all the dependecies and bundles them up into a single\nfile called <em>build/widgets.min.js</em>. It also copies some additional\nresources (e.g. images and CSS files) to the same <em>build</em> directory.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Using the Pattern on a Page</h3>\n\n<p>Now that we have defined, configured and bundled our Hello World pattern, it\'s time\nto use it and see how it works. Inside the root "mockup" directory create a simple HTML\nfile called <em>hello.html</em> with the following contents:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Hello World Pattern&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/jquery/jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="<strong>build/widgets.min.js</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;label class="<strong>pat-helloworld</strong>"&gt;(no greeting yet)&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</pre>\n<strong>XXX: markup highlighting?</strong>\n\n<p>In the head we first include jQuery and <em>widgets.min.js</em> generated in the\nprevious step. The body of the document contains a label with some placeholder text.\nThe important thing here is its <strong>pat-helloworld</strong> CSS class. It tells\nthe <em>helloworld</em> pattern that it should perform its work on this particular\nDOM element. This, by the way, is the general way of triggering the patterns - you\nadd a CSS class pat-&lt;pattern-name&gt; to the desired elements and the pattern\n&lt;pattern-name&gt; will be executed on them.</p>\n\n<p>In case we want to apply more than one pattern to a single DOM element, we can\nsimply assign multiple <em>pat-*</em> CSS classes to it.</p>\n\n<p>To test the Hello World pattern open the <em>hello.html</em> file with your\nbrowser directly from the filesystem and you should see "Hello, world!" displayed.\nThis text is different from the original label text - our Hello World pattern\nautomatically changed it.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Adding Configuration Options to a Pattern</h2>\n\n<p>Patterns can provide various configuration options for customizing their\nappearance and/or behavior. Let\'s modify our Hello World pattern so that it will\nallow us to change the label\'s font color and its background color.</p>\n\n<p>We first need to update the pattern definition in <em>js/patterns/hello.js</em>:</p>\n\n<pre>\nvar HelloWorld = Base.extend({\n    name: \'helloworld\',\n    <strong>defaults: {\n        \'color\': \'black\',\n        \'bgcolor\': \'yellow\'\n    },</strong>\n    init: function () {\n        var $label = this.$el;\n        $label.text("Hello, world!");\n        <strong>$label.css({\n            \'color\': this.options.color,\n            \'background\': this.options.bgcolor\n        });</strong>\n    }\n});\n</pre>\n\n<p>We added a new attribute called <strong>defaults</strong> to the object\ndescribing the Hello World pattern. The value of this attribute is another object\ncontaining the <em>&lt;option-name&gt;: &lt;default-value&gt;</em> pairs, which\nshould be pretty self-explanatory.</p>\n\n<p>In the <em>init()</em> method we added a code which sets the label\'s font and\nbackground color as defined by the pattern configuration options. Option values can be\nread through the <em>this.options</em> object (with <em>this</em> pointing to the\nobject describing the pattern).</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Since we have changed the pattern\'s code we need to run the\n<code>make bundle-widgets</code> command from the console again, so that the JavaScript\nbundle will contain the enhanced version of the Hello World pattern we just created.</p>\n\n<h3>The <em>data-pat-&lt;pattern-name&gt;</em> Attribute</h3>\n\n<p>To see the changes in action, we slightly modify the <em>hello.html</em> file. The\n&lt;body&gt; should now contain the following:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;label class="pat-helloworld"\n    <strong>data-pat-helloworld="color:white; bgcolor:black"</strong>&gt;(no greeting yet)&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;label class="pat-helloworld"\n    <strong>data-pat-helloworld="color:green"</strong>&gt;(no greeting yet)&lt;/label&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>And the result of the change:</p>\n<span style="color:white; background:black; cursor:default">Hello, world!</span><br>\n<span style="color:green; background:yellow; cursor:default">Hello, world!</span><br><br>\n\n\n<p>We added another label and defined the <strong>data-pat-helloworld</strong>\nattribute on both. The <em>data-pat-&lt;pattern-name&gt;</em> attribute is used\nto pass configuration options to the pattern (<em>color</em> and <em>bgcolor</em>\nin our case). If some of the options are not provided, their corresponding default\nvalues are used (as defined by the pattern). This is why the second label gets\na yellow background even though we haven\'t explicitly specified it.</p>\n\n<p>If you wonder whether it is possible for a DOM element to have more than\none <em>data-pat-*</em> attribute defined, the answer is of course YES, because\nmultiple patterns can be applied to a single DOM element at the same time.</p>\n\n<h3>Options Format</h3>\n\n<p>There are two different ways to specify the option values in <em>data-pat-*</em>\nattributes, the key:value format and the JSON dictionary format.</p>\n\n<h4>Key : Value</h4>\n<p>This is the format we used in the example above. Each key represents the option\nwith the same name, while the corresponding value is, well, the option\'s value. The\nkey and the value are separated with a colon (:) and a semicolon (;) is used to\nseparate multiple <em>key:value</em> pairs.</p>\n\n<h4>JSON Dictionary</h4>\n<p>This format, too, uses the <em>key:value</em> pairs, but they are passed in\na JSON dictionary, like this: <code>data-pat-helloworld="{color:white, bgcolor:black}"</code></p>\n\n<p>Generally it doesn\'t really matter which of the two formats you use. In most\ncases it is simply a matter of personal preference. There is, however, one notable\nadvantage of the JSON format - the option values are not limited to just strings and\nnumbers, they can also be arbitrary JSON-compatible structures (even nested).\nSometimes when a pattern expects a complex configuration, JSON format is your\nonly choice.</p>\n\n<h3>Nesting the Options</h3>\n<p>Setting the same options for many different elements over and over again can be a\ntedious task. It also makes it more difficult to globally change such options later.\nLuckily the patterns provide a mechanism to avoid problems like these and that is\n<em>option nesting</em>. It works as follows - you can define a <em>data-pat-*</em>\nattribute on an element somewhere in the DOM hierarchy and all its descendants\n(at all levels) will <em>inherit the option values</em> listed there! This is\nquite a useful feature indeed.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose we modify the <em>&lt;body&gt;</em> tag in our <em>hello.html</em>\npage and add <em>data-pat-helloworld</em> attribute to it:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&lt;body <strong>data-pat-helloworld="bgcolor:orange"</strong>&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Suddenly all the elements using the Hello World pattern will get an orange\nbackground by default, even though the true default background color as defined by\nthe pattern is yellow. Elements can override this behavior by explicitly providing\nther own value for the <em>bgcolor</em> option.</p>\n\n<p>If you now reload the <em>hello.html</em> file in your browser, you should see\nthe following:</p>\n<span style="color:white; background:black; cursor:default">Hello, world!</span><br>\n<span style="color:green; background:orange; cursor:default">Hello, world!</span><br><br>\n\n<p>The bottom of the two labels now indeed has an orange background, because that\'s\nthe option value that an element further up the hierarchy provides. On the other\nhand the background color of the upper label remains black, because that label\nprovides its own value for the <em>bgcolor</em> option, overriding the value set\nby the <em>&lt;body&gt;</em> tag. We can see that the option values defined at lower\nlevels have precedence over those defined higher up the DOM tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Writing Tests</h2>\n<p>It\'s true that our Hello World pattern is very simple and doesn\'t contain\nany obscure bugs, but with more complex patterns you can never be sure. And even\nif they work flawlessly at the moment, there\'s always a chance of introducing bugs\nwhen adding new features or refactoring the existing ones. This is where the tests\ncome in. They can automatically run the patterns in different usecase scenarios and\nmake sure they behave as expected.</p>\n\n<h3>Defining a Test Module</h3>\n\n<p>All tests are placed in the <em>tests</em> subdirectory and the names of the files\ncontaining them must match the <em>*-test.js</em> pattern. It is a good practice to\nname the files after the pattern they test. Since we want to test the Hello World\npattern, we create a file called <em>tests/pattern-helloworld-test.js</em> and put\nthe following code into it:</p>\n\n<pre>\ndefine([\n    <strong>\'chai\',</strong>\n    \'jquery\',\n    <strong>\'mockup-registry\',</strong>\n    <strong>\'mockup-patterns-helloworld\'</strong>\n], function (chai, $, registry, HelloWorld) {\n    \n\n    var expect = chai.expect,\n        <strong>mocha = window.mocha;</strong>\n\n    <strong>mocha.setup(\'bdd\');</strong>\n\n    <strong>$.fx.off = true;</strong>  //disable jQuery animations for various reasons\n\n    <strong>describe</strong>("HelloWorld", function () {\n        <strong>beforeEach</strong>(function () {\n            this.$el = $(\n                \'&lt;label class="pat-helloworld"&gt;(no greeting yet)&lt;/label&gt;\'\n            );\n        });\n\n        <strong>it</strong>(\'should change label text to "Hello, world!"\', function () {\n            expect(this.$el.text()).to.not.be.equal("Hello, world!");\n            <strong>registry.scan(this.$el);</strong>\n            expect(this.$el.text()).to.be.equal("Hello, world!");\n        });\n    });\n\n});</pre>\n<strong>XXX: we really need syntax highlighting and line numbers &hellip;</strong>\n\n<p>Test modules are defined in a similar way to patterns. We call the <em>define()</em>\nfunction, list the module dependencies and provide a function which contains the actual\ntest code. Let\'s first explain some of the dependencies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n  <strong>chai</strong> - <a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a> is an assertion\n  library complementing the <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a>\n  test framework, which is what Plone Mockup project uses for tests. The Chai\n  library is quite flexible as it allows you to choose your preferred style for\n  making assertions in tests. In our example we use the so-called <em>BDD</em> style,\n  allowing for assertions such as <code>expect(result).to.be.above(0).and.not.equal(7)</code>.\n </li>\n\n  <li><strong>mockup-registry</strong> - the <em>registry</em> is a collection of tools\n  used for managing the patterns. It also keeps track of which patterns have\n  been registered, hence its name.<br>\n  In our example we use its <strong>scan()</strong> method, which scans the given\n  DOM (sub)tree and applies patterns to all DOM elements in the tree where\n  applicable.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>mockup-patterns-helloworld</strong> - the pattern under test must\n  always be listed among the test dependencies, even if we don\'t use it directly in\n  the test code (as is the case here with our example). The reason is that the\n  <em>registry.scan($element)</em> method will apply our pattern to the\n  <var>$element</var> only if the pattern is present in the test module\'s dependency\n  list.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the body of the test module we choose the aforementioned\n<a href="http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/">BDD style</a> for our assertion statements:\n<code>mocha.setup(\'bdd\')</code>. We also disable jQuery animations\n(<code>$.fx.off = true</code>) for a couple of good reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Asynchronous animations on DOM elements might finish only after the test case\n  has already come to an end. If the latter expects that a pattern changes\n  some property of an element, but the change is delayed due to animation, an\n  assertion in the test might erroneously fail.</li>\n  <li>Speed - in most cases animations are just an eye candy for the users, and\n  as such, are not needed during the test runs. Disabling them can sometimes\n  considerably cut down the time needed to complete the tests.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>The <em>describe()</em> Function</h4>\n\n<p>We define a group of test cases by using the\n<a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#interfaces">describe()</a> function\nfound in the aforementioned Mocha test framework. The first parameter is the\nname for the test case group, which could be anything, really (and not necessarily\n<em>"HelloWorld"</em>). The second parameter is a function containing the actual test\ncase definitions and/or the definitions of the test case subgroups (yes, we can nest\nthe <em>describe()</em> function).</p>\n\n<p>In our example we only have a single test case and it is defined by a call to the\n<strong>it()</strong> function. We first provide a descriptive name for the test\ncase, which makes it very easy to see, what this test case expects from the\npattern under test (<em>\'It should change label text to "Hello, world!"\'</em>).\nThe second parameter is a function containing the actual test case code. It first\nverifies that the label does not yet have the expected text. Then it invokes\nthe <em>registry.scan()</em> method (to apply the pattern) and after that it checks\nagain to see, whether the pattern has indeed changed the text to\n<em>"Hello, world!"</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The last thing to mention is the <strong>beforeEach()</strong> function. The test\nframework calls this function before each test case is run, giving us the\nopportunity to perform some initialization and setup work in it. This way we don\'t\nhave to repeat the same common initializiation tasks separately in each test case,\nresulting in a more readable and maintainable code. In our concrete example, all\nthat we do in <em>beforeEach()</em> is create a jQuery object representing an HTML\nlabel, which later serves as a convenient test polygon for the Hello World pattern.</p>\n\n<p>Note that regarding the tests, we have only scratched the surface here. Describing\nall the options the test framework provides is beyond the scope of this tutorial.\nTo learn more about how to write tests, please consult Mocha\'s\n<a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">documentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Running the Tests</h3>\n\n<p>To run our test run the following console command from the <em>&lt;mockup&gt;</em>\ndirectory:</p>\n\n<pre>\n$ make test pattern=helloworld\n</pre>\n\n<p>Ignore DEBUG messages and examine the last line of output. It should be\nsimilar to the following:</p>\n\n<pre>PhantomJS 1.9.2 (Linux): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.4 secs / 0.008 secs)</pre>\n\n<p>The test runner informed us that our test passed. Yay!</p>\n\n<p>If you want to run the test for all patterns, run the <code>make test</code>\ncommand with no parameters:</p>\n\n<pre>\n$ make test\n</pre>\n\n<p>You might have noticed that when tests complete, the <code>make test</code> command\ndoes not terminate. That\'s because it ran\n<a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma</a>, a powerful JavaScript test runner,\nbehind the scenes. Karma launched a process which now monitors our pattern and\npattern test files for changes.</p>\n\n<p>With Karma still running, try changing the <em>js/patterns/hello.js</em> file so\nthat the Hello World pattern changes the label text to something else than\n<em>"Hello, world!"</em>. Karma will detect the change and automatically re-run the\ntest(s) which will now, of course, fail. If you now change the\n<em>tests/pattern-helloworld-test.js</em> so that it will accept the new behavior of\nthe Hello World pattern, Karma will once more re-run the tests, which will now again\npass.</p>\n\n<p>Another nice thing about Karma is that you can connect to the test runner with\na browser, too. Visit <a href="http://localhost:9876">http://localhost:9876</a> and\nwatch what happens in the console window. Search for a line resembling the one\nbelow:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&hellip;\nINFO [Firefox 25.0.0 (Ubuntu)]: Connected on socket IH_Zu1A3ZL27f5IBYKnr\n&hellip;\n</pre>\n\n<p>When Karma detects that a browser has connected to it, it runs all the tests\n<em>in that particular browser</em>! Isn\'t that great? It allows you to quickly\ntest the behavior of a pattern in many different browsers. When you make a change,\nKarma will automatically run the tests for all the browsers currently connected to\nit.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, just more more thing - at this point some of you might be wondering, what\nbrowser Karma used the first time we ran the <code>make test</code> command, when we\nhad not yet connected to <em>localhost:9876</em> with any of the browsers?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>. It\'s a WebKit-based\n"browser" without user interface, but with a JavaScript API for communicating\nwith it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deployment</h2>\n\n<p>To wrap up everything, we just need to add a couple of words on deployment. When\nyou\'re done with development, you somehow need to share your code with other people\nwho might want to use it in their projects or in production environments.</p>\n\n<p>We have already mentioned the <code>make bundle-widgets</code> command. It\nbundles all the patterns and their dependencies into a single JavaScript file\n<em>widgets.min.js</em> located in the <em>build</em> subdirectory. After a\nsuccessful build all you have to do is copy this file to wherever you need it\nand link to it in your HTML pages  - just like we did in <em>hello.html</em>\nearlier.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to develop patterns in the context of a larger project, you\nhave an option to include them in development mode. This way you will not have to\nre-bundle them every time you make a change. To achieve that, add Plone Mockup\nproject as a dependency to your <a href="http://www.buildout.org">buildout</a>\nconfig file, something like below:\n\n<pre>\n[buildout]\nextensions = mr.developer\n&hellip;\nparts +=\n    mockup\n&hellip;\nauto-checkout +=\n    mockup\n&hellip;\neggs +=\n    mockup\n&hellip;\n[mockup]\nrecipe = collective.recipe.cmd\non_install = true\non_update = true\nnix_path=~/.nix-defexpr/channels/\ncmds =\n    cd ${buildout:sources-dir}/mockup\n    make bootstrap NIX_PATH=${:nix_path}\n&hellip;\n[sources]\nmockup = git https://github.com/plone/mockup\n</pre>\n\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n  <li>\n    <ul>\n     <p>\n     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqUn3n4HuMM"\n     target ="_blank">An introductory overview</a>\n     of Plone Mockup - about the project and its goals, setting up a development\n     environment, Patterns explained, testing JavaScript with Mocha library,\n     compiling and deploying widgets, etc. (recorded Hangout session from the\n     Pacific Rim Sprint, Sep 13, 2013)</p>\n\n     <p>Video length: 58:05</p>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n\n'}),define("text!docs-contribute",[],function(){return"# Code conventions\n\nIt's still on TODO list to write this down, but for now make sure you keep\njshint job happy.\n\nTo run jshint on mockup code you have to type: ```make jsint```.\n\n\n# Git workflow / branching model\n\nIt is important that you *NEVER* commit to master directly. Even for the\nsmallest and most trivial fix. *ALWAYS* send pull request and ask somebody else\nto merge your code. *NEVER* merge it yourself.\n\nIf you dont get feedback on your pull request in a day please come to\n```#plone-framework``` and ping ```@garbas``` or ```@vangheem``` about it.\n\nMain goal of this process is not to boss developers around and make their live\nharder, but to bring bigger stability to development of mockup and to make\nreleases smooth and predictable.\n\n\n# Pull request checklist\n\nChecklist of things that every person excepting pull request should follow (or\nelse @garbas will make you drink mongolian coctail - I promise!).\n\n - Title and description of pull request *MUST* be descriptive and needs to\n   reflect changes in code. Please review line by line and comment if code\n   change was not mentioned in description of the pull request.\n\n - Copy the title of pull request to current ticket tracking changes for\n   realease under development. (example:\n   https://github.com/plone/mockup/issues/250)\n\n - Full test suite (running test on saucelabs against real browsers) will only\n   be triggered for master branch and pull requests. It is important that tests\n   pass before you merge it.\n\n   Please note that sometimes travis job hangs due to many reasons and you need\n   to restart it.\n\n   Due to some bugs on Travis reporting of status be sure to always check on \n   https://travis-ci.org/plone/mockup/pull_requests if the tests really passed.\n\n - It is important never to lower code coverage. Check it on [coveralls]( \n   https://coveralls.io/r/plone/mockup) if coverage dropped. It should be\n   automaticaly reported once tests are passing.\n   \n   Also make sure that every new function (or bigger chunk of code) that enters\n   mockup is tested.\n\n - All commits need to be rebased on current master and squashed into one\n   single commit. Commit's title (first line) and description (row 3 and below)\n   should be identical to pull request.\n\n - If all of the above is checked, go ahead and merge pull request. Make sure\n   you always use a polite tone and explain why this is needed by linking to\n   this document.\n\n\n# Changing this page\n\nWhen changing this document, it must be done in public with a possibility for\nother to comment or at least to be aware of the changes.\n\nCreate a pull request with proposed changes and describe reasoning why change\nis needed.\n"}),this.sinon=function(){var
